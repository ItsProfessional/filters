# filters
My filter lists for uBlock Origin.

## Contributing

- All filters must be of uBO's syntax - even if the syntax is supported for compatibility, e.g. AdGuard's syntax, for example.
- Avoid procedural filters (such as `:has-text()` and `:upward()`) when possible
- Scriptlets must only be used in the `Behaviour` section.
- Mobile-specific filters go into `mobile.txt`
